This folder contains the code necessary to reproduce the figures in Hockeimer et al., 2023. 
If you have any issues please email the first author at wih38@pitt.edu
------
Dependencies:
- python 3.1 or later
- jupyter
- matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, and related scientific packages you would get from
the anaconda distribution
- put this repo on your python path as there are several py files outside this directory (but in the same
repo) with code necessary for analysis. 
------
All data files are available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W4BKht6AXN1RS5Xxz2u_ksZhX5ZgZUiY?usp=sharing
Please download that folder and, as mentioned below, each file contains locations to define your local directory as a variable the analysis scripts will use. 
------
Figure 1 does not have any statistical analysis and therefore no code needed to generate the figures
------
Figures 2-5, and supplement have .py files with the figure number in the name, e.g. figure2_Characterization_code.py

Each file contains a number of cell blocks (initiated with "#%%") that can be run separately

Figures require the blocks to be run in order because later blocks often depend on calculations performed
in earlier ones

In each file there is a variable initialized early on called datapath or path that you should change 
based on where you saved the data. You should download the data from the link provided to a new folder
and have the datapath/path variable point there

For figures 4 and the supplement some panels are found in the figure 6 folder's jupyter notebook
and these are indicated as such. 
------
Figure 6 has a directory within which is all the data you need and a jupyter notebook with the code
Notebooks work similarly to code blocks and each cell should be run in order.
Here, in addition to defining your datapath you need to define further down (cell 6, line 1) the path to your github where you cloned this repo
